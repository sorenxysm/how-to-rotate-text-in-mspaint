    <h1><u>My wife is a hypothetical concept.</u></h1>
    <h2><i>Esoteric</i>, if you will.</h2>
    <p>She's intangible and exists purely for one liners that are not at all funny in some circumstances.</p>
    <p>If she herself is intangible that means my sex life is also intangible, but also exists in that hypothetical realm, since although my wife isn't real she is real for the sake of the one-liner.</p>
    <p>That means that the sex we have is also the one-liner.</p>
    <p>Sex, in this case, is being used more in the sense of "funny, quirky" one-liner more than the love life of me and my hypothetical wife. The metaphysical love me and my wife share is not used as the one-liner.</p>
    <p>To be seen among social groups, the "love" exists in seriousness, the "sex" exists in the realm of comedy. Perhaps it is unexpected to state such a private matter in front of a bunch of individuals out of nowhere.</p>
    <p>Here, to break the norms of regular interaction, exists purely in the realm of the funny or awkward.</p>
